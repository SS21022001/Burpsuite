# Burpsuite
Tryhackme Walkthrough

Burp Suite is the industry standard tool for web application hacking, and is essential in any web penetration test.
This module will cover the basic functionality of the core tools in the Burp Suite framework: Proxy, Target, Repeater, Intruder, Sequencer, Decoder, Comparer, and Extender. You will learn how to apply Burp Suite when enumerating and attacking realistic web applications, as well as how to approach some of the common scenarios you may encounter when attacking a web app.

Burp Suite is a powerful web application security testing tool used by security professionals and researchers. It is developed by PortSwigger, and it provides a comprehensive set of features for finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. Here are some key points about Burp Suite:

1. Functionality: Burp Suite is primarily used for web application penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. It combines various tools and functionalities to identify security flaws, analyze network traffic, and simulate attacks against web applications.

2. Proxy Server: Burp Suite acts as a proxy server between the web browser and the target application, allowing you to intercept and modify the HTTP(S) traffic. This feature enables detailed inspection and manipulation of requests and responses exchanged between the client and the server.

3. Scanner: Burp Suite includes an automated scanner that can crawl web applications, identify common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more. The scanner attempts to detect vulnerabilities by automatically sending crafted requests and analyzing the responses.

4. Spidering and Site Mapping: Burp Suite includes a spidering feature that automatically explores a website, following links and mapping out its structure. This helps in comprehensive coverage of the application during testing and identifying hidden or overlooked areas.

5. Intruder: Burp Suite's Intruder tool allows for automated and manual brute-forcing, fuzzing, and payload-based attacks against specific parameters or parts of a web application. It assists in identifying vulnerabilities by varying input values and observing application behavior.

6. Repeater: The Repeater tool allows you to modify and reissue individual requests, making it helpful for manual testing and analyzing application responses. It enables you to tweak parameters, headers, and payloads to observe how the application behaves under different scenarios.

7. Extensibility: Burp Suite provides an extensible platform that allows users to develop their own custom extensions using its Extender API. This enables the integration of additional functionality and automation tailored to specific testing requirements.

8. Reporting: Burp Suite generates detailed reports summarizing the vulnerabilities identified during testing. Reports can be customized and exported in various formats, helping security professionals communicate findings to stakeholders effectively.

It's important to note that while Burp Suite is a powerful tool for security testing, it should only be used against applications you have proper authorization to test. Unauthorized use or testing against live production systems without permission is unethical and potentially illegal.
